    "# NN to classifie handwriten numbers with pytorch\n",
    "In this document the pytorch library is implemented and tested to recognize handwritten numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following repository was used as training and validation datenset: https://github.com/kensanata/numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "First the trainings and validation data is loaded. Afterwards the model is implemented and trained. An evaluation checks whether overfitting is present. A test on a real image tests the usability in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "The test works very well overall. First there were problems in the recognition of the number three. This was recognized as nine. By increasing the hidden layers the problem could be solved.\n",
